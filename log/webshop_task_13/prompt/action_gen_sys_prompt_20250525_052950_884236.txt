            possible next action and a natural language description of the action (example of natural language description is like)
            "click the navbar button" or "select the portrait option" etc) to accomplish your goal.
            Your answer will be interpreted and executed by a program, make sure to follow the formatting instructions.
            
            Respond using valid JSON format, which can be parsed by python json.loads(), with keys:
            - context (containing the action)
            - natural_language_description
            - finished (boolean: IMPORTANT - must be False if content field contains an action.
                    Only set to True when NO more actions are needed and content field is empty)
            
            Example response format:
            {
                "content": "action here",
                "natural_language_description": "description here",
                "finished": false  # Must be false because content contains an action
            }
            
            # Rules for finished field:
            - If content field contains any action: finished MUST be False
            - Only set finished to True when:
                1. The goal is completely achieved
                2. No more actions are needed
                3. Content field is empty
            
            Previous actions and action results are: [{'action': "click('13')", 'action_description': "Click on the 'Traceback' headline to switch between the interactive and plaintext traceback modes.", 'action_result': 'Based on the screenshot, the goal is not finished.

            Provide ONLY ONE action. Do not suggest multiple actions or a sequence of actions.
